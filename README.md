This is the software side of a Raspberry Pi microcontoller project. The device being built will allow users to see the departure times of the next NY/NJ PATH Trains (think subway) into NYC from Grove Street station in New Jersey on a LED light display. So the next time you are near Grove St. station in Jersey City and you're thinking about going into NYC, just look over at your (Raspberry Pi with Wi-Fi capabilities connected to a) LED screen which hangs on your wall, and you'll know whether to mosey, walk, or run to make the next train. No need to take out your web-browsing device to navigate to the PATH train website or call on a language model assistant; just turn your head and look at your Raspberry Pi project hanging on the wall in your apartment. (Art + Functionality)

This code scrapes data from the Path website. There is a next PATH tain API that a developer (mrazza; https://path.api.razza.dev/v1/stations/grove_street/realtime ) made available, but we did not want to rely on an existing API. We wanted a more general solution for a situation where information could be found on a webpage, but where there was no convenient API available. If the information is on a webpage (even if dynamically loaded), we should be able to get it on to a LED screen.

Disclaimer: You'll need to update this logic if the layout of the PATH train webpage changes.
